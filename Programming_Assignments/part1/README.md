* Implemented with Python 2.7.15

###  Tasks
* Exercise 1. Implement an algorithm that takes as input three points in the plane. checks
that they form a triangle and whether the interior of the triangle contains the origin (0, 0) or
not.

* Exercise 2. Given a circle of radius r in the plane with (0, 0) as center, implement an
algorithm that finds the total lattice points on the circumference. Lattice Points are points
with integer coordinates.

* Exercise 3. Implement the incremental 2D algorithm for computing the convex hull of a
finite set of points in the plane.

* Exercise 4. Implement the gift wrap algorithm for computing the convex hull of a finite
set of points in the plane.
